# Guided Clinical Reasoning with LLMs: Reconstructing the PHQ-9 from Multimodal Inputs  
**Anonymous Repository for ICHI 2026 Submission**

This repository has been created under an anonymized account for the submission of the paper:  
**“Guided Clinical Reasoning with LLMs: Reconstructing the PHQ-9 from Multimodal Inputs”** to the **ICHI 2026 Conference**.

## Contents
- **LLM Prompts (anonymized):**  
  Prompts provided to large language models (LLMs), with the original input data removed.  

- **LLM Outputs:**  
  All model outputs from the trials described in the paper.  

  Note: Output files include participants who satisfied the broader, modality-specific inclusion criteria.  
  For example, trials that did not use Fitbit data were not filtered on Fitbit requirements.

## Important Notes
- The **results reported in the paper** were calculated on the **common set of participants** used in the *all-modalities trial*.  
- The full set of outputs is released here to allow additional validation.  
  - This enables future performance statistics to be recalculated on the same basis if needed.

## Anonymity & Future Availability
- This repository exists solely for the **peer-review process**.
